# CNN
This CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) is an implemetation of my personal research in deep learning on windows with visual studio 2013.Basically C++ image library Opencv is used in this project.
# Support
Visual Studio 2012、Visual Studio 2013、Visual Studio 2010 have been tested to support this project.Opencv 3.0 is also recommended.
